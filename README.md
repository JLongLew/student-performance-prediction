# Student Performance Prediction via Online Learning Behavior Analytics
## 1.0 Learning Outcomes
CLO 1: 	Demonstrate an understanding of advanced concepts in artificial intelligence.<br>
CLO 2: 	Evaluate designs of artificial intelligencec systems to solve practical problems.<br>
CLO 3: 	Develop a software artefact that models/simulates intelligent bahavior for a given problem domain using appropriate tools.<br>

## 2.0. Requirements
1. The dataset is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data)
2. The model must be constructed from the angle of online learning behaviors or adaptability of online learning. The model should be started with collecting data, pre-processing stage, defining dimensions/indicators in learning behavior analysis, developing the model using a machine learning algorithm, and producing the outcome as a predictive model.
3. You may enhance the model by comparing the accuracy of the model in varieties of algorithms. Another consideration of your model can added pattern or classification of student performance.

### Part 1 Design
<b>1. Explain the chosen online learning behavior indicator and dimension </b><br>
Study and review some articles to get an idea for choosing or selecting online learning behavior indicators and dimensions in online learning for the student performance prediction model.<br>
<b>2. Design an architecture framework for proposed model </b><br>
Produce the overall design (flowchart / sketch/algorithm) of the proposed solution that uses input from the academic performance via online learning to predict the student performance based on indicators was discussed.<br>
<b>3. Overall Design of architecture framework </b><br>
Produce the overall design (flowchart) of the complete model. Justify all assumptions made and highlight any additional features to be incorporated (e.g., error handling, usability/user experience features, etc.).<br>

### Part 2 Implementation
<b>1. Software to Implement Artificial Intelligence/Scripts/Functions </b><br>
The software artefact/prototype is to be built using Jupiter. Ensure that your Jupiter routines are properly formatted, devoid of syntax errors, and fully executable. Clearly label your routines with comments to aid understanding. Take advantage of Jupiter's capability in matrix processing to simplify routines. Any other software tools used must be detailed.<br>
<b>2. Plotting Experimental Data </b><br>
The plots relating to the setup and results of the Artificial Intelligence systems used should be displayed. The predicted values should be plotted on the same graph as the actual data, for ease of comparison. Ensure that appropriate axes labels, legends, symbols, etc. are used. <br>
<b>3. Simulating Artificial Intelligence Systems/Tools </b><br>
The plots relating to the setup and results of the Artificial Intelligence systems used should be displayed. The predicted values should be plotted on the same graph as the actual data, for ease of comparison. Ensure that appropriate axes labels, legends, symbols, etc. are used.<br>
